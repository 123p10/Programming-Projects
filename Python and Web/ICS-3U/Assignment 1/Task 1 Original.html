																			 There are multiple fields of programming and all require a different level of expertise.
																			 There are front end web developers who create the interface and deal with the user input of a website they will use programming languages such as HTML,CSS or Javascript.
																			 There are back end web developers who control the data and the stuff users cannot interact with they will use languages such as PHP, SQL or Ruby on Rails.
																			 There are application developers who create software for often consumer uses and use languages such as C,C++,C#,Java,Python or Ruby.
